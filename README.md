# My Excel Project Data Analytics Projects

## 📊 Data Science Job Market Analysis
Overview

This project examines the data science job market, focusing on skills demand, salary trends, job titles, and geographic location. Using Excel as the primary analysis tool, I examined how various skills influence pay, identified the most in-demand skills, and investigated whether possessing multiple skills results in higher salaries.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data analysis, visualization, and business insight generation using real-world job data.

This chart shows the most frequently requested skills in data roles.
SQL and Excel dominate, followed by Python, Tableau, and Power BI, highlighting the importance of both technical and analytical tools.

2️⃣ Do More Skills Mean Higher Pay?

This scatter plot compares median salary to the average number of skills requested per role.
Results show a positive correlation, with senior and engineering roles requiring more skills and offering higher salaries.

This visualization compares skill demand with median salary.
Some highly paid skills are less common, while widely requested skills don’t always yield the highest pay—showing the value of specialized expertise.
